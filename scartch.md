# University Advice for High School and First-Year Students

## Introduction

Many high school and first-year university students seek advice on choosing courses, universities, and career paths. I often receive messages and emails about this topic, and while I'm happy to help, I think it would be beneficial to compile my thoughts into a guide. This document addresses common misconceptions, pitfalls, and general advice for navigating university life and beyond.

## Your Course and University

### ATAR Traps

Aiming for a high ATAR is commendable, but don't be misled by degrees with inflated entry requirements (excluding fields like medicine, dentistry, etc.). Just because a course requires a high ATAR doesn't mean it guarantees better career outcomes. Many students choose degrees like Commerce or Computer Science simply because they seem like the 'best' use of their ATAR, only to find that it doesn’t lead to the success they envisioned.

**Key Takeaways:**
- High ATAR requirements don't always equate to better career opportunities.
- Choose a degree based on your interests and long-term goals, not prestige.
- Research what the degree actually entails to avoid disappointment.

### What Do You Want to Do? (Even if You're Unsure)

Most Year 12 students don't have a clear idea of their future career. This uncertainty is normal. Many students choose degrees like commerce without understanding the full scope of the financial sector. Similarly, it's possible to graduate with a computer science degree without strong coding skills.

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What subjects do you genuinely enjoy?
- What fields do you find interesting but haven't explored?
- Are there industries or companies you're curious about?

Exploring options during your first year or through double degrees can help clarify your path.

## Choosing the Right University

Everyone has heard of the Group of Eight (Go8) universities, Australia's leading research institutions. However, university rankings primarily reflect research output, not undergraduate teaching quality or student experience.

**Important Considerations:**
- University reputation doesn't always translate to better undergraduate experiences.
- Some universities excel in specific fields. For example:
  - Monash is renowned for pharmacy.
  - UNSW offers cutting-edge computer science courses (Rust programming, Canva collaboration).
- Proximity to home and lifestyle factors can be just as important as reputation.

**Tip:** If you're interested in research, choosing a university with strong postgraduate programs can open up more opportunities.

## Career Prospects: Degrees and Their Value

Degrees fall into two broad categories:

1. **Specialized Degrees (Required for Specific Careers):**
   - Medicine, law, nursing, engineering, etc.
   - Completion of these degrees is essential for entering these fields.

2. **Flexible Degrees (Pathways to Multiple Careers):**
   - Mathematics, computer science, physics, data science, etc.
   - These degrees provide transferable skills applicable to software engineering, finance, and more.

**Key Insight:** Many companies prioritize skills and experience over degree titles. A quantitative background (maths, physics, CS) opens doors to diverse industries.

## A Closer Look at Specific Degrees

### Mathematics as a Degree

Studying mathematics is often misunderstood. In high school, math is about computation, but university-level math emphasizes theory, proofs, and rigor. Many students struggle with this transition, especially in courses like linear algebra.

**Why Study Mathematics?**
- It complements almost any other degree.
- Fields like machine learning, finance, physics, and engineering heavily rely on math.
- Core topics (linear algebra, calculus, probability) have broad applications.
- It sharpens problem-solving and analytical thinking skills.

**Examples of Application:**
- Machine learning requires probability theory, calculus, and linear algebra.
- Quantitative finance uses mathematical finance models (e.g., Black-Scholes).
- Physics and engineering frequently use complex numbers and differential equations.

### Computer Science, Software Engineering, and IT

- **Computer Science:** Focuses on theory, algorithms, and systems.
- **Software Engineering:** Emphasizes practical application and project management.
- **Information Technology (IT):** Practical skills in managing and deploying systems.

**Tips:**
- Research the curriculum differences.
- Pursue internships to gain practical experience.
- Coding projects and hackathons enhance employability.

---

### Law as an Undergraduate Degree

Some universities offer direct-entry undergraduate law degrees (LLB), while others (like UniMelb) require postgraduate study (JD).

**Advice:**
- If you're certain about pursuing law, consider universities offering an undergraduate pathway.
- Double degrees with law allow flexibility. You can drop law if it isn't the right fit.

---

### Understanding the UniMelb Model

UniMelb's model requires breadth subjects and often leads to postgraduate study. While this model suits some students, others find it limiting, especially in STEM fields where honors programs are scarce.

**Considerations:**
- Breadth subjects can broaden your knowledge but may feel unnecessary for STEM students.
- Postgraduate pathways can be more expensive and time-consuming.
- If you prefer a direct route to specialization, other universities might be better options.

## Succeeding in University

### Study Habits

Success at university often correlates with genuine interest in your subjects. Passion drives you to spend more time learning and mastering concepts.

**Tips for Better Study Habits:**
- Engage with topics that excite you.
- Seek help early if you struggle.
- Form study groups and collaborate with peers.
- Use online resources and textbooks beyond what is taught in lectures.

---

### Earning Money and Gaining Experience

**Options for University Students:**
- Internships (industry experience and networking)
- Tutoring (reinforces your own learning)
- Freelance projects (builds your portfolio)
- Research assistant roles (good for academic careers)

---

### Learning How to Learn

University isn't just about obtaining a degree—it's about developing the skill of learning itself. The ability to independently learn new subjects is invaluable for lifelong success.

**Tips for Lifelong Learning:**
- Take courses outside your comfort zone.
- Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- Stay curious and open to new ideas.

## Final Thoughts

Your university experience will shape your future, but there is no single correct path. Follow your interests, stay flexible, and focus on developing skills that will serve you well in any career. If you're unsure, reach out to people in your desired field and ask questions—most are happy to help.
