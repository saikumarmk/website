## Introduction

When it comes to first impressions for your application, it's nearly always the résumé that gets you to the next round. While the document you pen with all your accomplishments or feats may be an irritating write, I recommend sticking to [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs), which is written in LaTeX. It's not particularly time-consuming to learn LaTeX, as you'll primarily be editing cells with your own entries, instead of creating new elements. I also advise against using online Resume makers, as they can take your information, and provide resumes that aren't always optimal. As for the resume looking bland with computer modern, that's a given, but the format is also straight and to the point. You may find that a more artistic/creative resume works too, however, I have opted to stick to a resume that delivers information ~~despite having interned at Canva~~. This article will also be opinionated, so you don't have to follow every bit of advice listed here, and you could certainly adopt another style of resume writing, but this is what has worked for a wide range of people.

So, what is the goal of creating a perfect resume? Well, creating a resume past a point is very subjective, and you should lend yourself to a variety of opinions, and adapt the advice in the industry you're applying to. Our goal here is the tech industry. But there are some key bits of terminology for you to know about.

### What recruiters look for (The Black Box Problem)

A lot of advice you'll receive is often anecdotal and comes from people who've found what works for them. You can ask recruiters what they look for, but it's important to note that recruitment can vary across companies, and recruiters can look for different attributes on a resume. As I suggest below, your best option is to aggregate the advice you receive. My personal frustrations with resumes are how the whole process of recruiting, or at least vetting resumes can seem like a black box, with the strongest resumes surviving into the next generation, but carrying potentially pointless artefacts.

### The Applicant Tracking System
 
The ATS (Applicant Tracking System) is software, typically used by companies to track the progression of applicants for a role. But you may commonly hear terms such as ATS-friendly for a resume. Many companies will scan your resume, and the software will then rip out keywords and try to make sense of your resume. For this reason, sticking to **one column** is one of the most important things you can do when writing your resume. Whether a place uses an ATS depends, though larger companies typically use them.

### Word or PDF?

There's always a debate about whether you should be submitting your resume as a `docx` file or as a `pdf` file. This depends on whether they ask you for a `pdf` file or a `docx` file, but in case they don't ask, just use a `pdf` file. In the past, resume parsers would struggle with `pdf` files, but times have caught up, and `pdf` files don't vary as much from computer to computer. 

### The importance of one-page resumes

While you may be tempted to fill your resume with a bunch of random leadership roles from high school to make your resume longer, note that you're only making it harder for a recruiter to pick up valuable insights about the type of candidate you are. While you're a student, ensure that your resume doesn't exceed one page, anything more and a recruiter may miss additional content. 

### Common Nit-picks

- Don't put in the full link for something, hyperlink it instead, so you have [Google](https://www.google.com) instead of [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com).
- Don't use skill rankings for your technical skills, there's no way to quantify your expertise, and the upper limit of expertise for a skill in general.
- Stick to one page, one column resumes.
- Don't add your face in, it takes up space and can lead to unintentional discrimination.
- Don't add your personal hobbies or interests. 

These are short and fast rules that I'd stick to.

### An Objective?

Some resumes have a short blurb describing the candidate and any information about them. I'm on the fence with these, you can include them, and it could be useful, however, you could also argue that it's a waste of space. Up to you.

### References

If a company wants your references, they'll ask for them. For this reason, I omit any mention of references, as they take up space without giving new information about you. Remember, a resume is a summarised document of your professional history, and you should work to ensure each point reflects that.

### Should you lie on a resume?

While I heavily discourage lying on a resume, the standard rule is, if you can't justify or talk about a point, then leave the point out. Sometimes, an interviewer will go over your resume, and ask you about it, so you should be able to talk about everything you've written down.


## Standard Order of Sections

So, let's talk about how you should order your resume. Your education typically comes first, followed by work experience, then volunteering work, projects, and a skills section. You're free to switch up the order of volunteering work and projects or omit one if you don't have anything for that area, but I would recommend having the section with more significant information higher up.

### Education

There should not be too much ambiguity here. Put your degree on there, with any majors or minors you are undertaking, along with an expected graduation date. If you have any achievements, such as a scholarship or a unit prize or similar, you can briefly note them down here. If you're a first-year and have anything relevant to your high school, it wouldn't hurt to put it down, but I recommend removing it early on, as your high school poses no relevance to the job you're applying for. If your WAM/GPA are noteworthy, then you can briefly list it, but you won't be looked down upon if you don't list it.

### Experience 

When ordering your experiences, ensure it's ordered in chronological order, that is the most recent role at the top. When you start university, it's fine to have unrelated work experience listed, however as you progress and gain new material, you can remove those experiences. The golden rule for mentioning what you did during each experience is to mention frameworks, libraries and languages, and also signify the impact of the work you did. Google mentions the "X by Y by Z" formula, where you "accomplished X as measured by Y, by doing Z" and I highly recommend doing this where possible. Also, prefer using dot points over sentences, they convey meaning faster (assuming you format them properly). You don't need to use the X-Y-Z formula for every dot point, but ensuring its presence helps a recruiter understand what work you did.


### Volunteering / Leadership

Any volunteering opportunity that you've participated in, such as being an active committee member of a society, is invaluable on a resume. My advice for this section is similar to that of the experience section, in that you should use the "X by Y by Z" formula, and mention anything that you believe would be relevant to the role. Additionally, discussing any responsibilities or experience with leadership is generally regarded well.


### Projects

The projects section is a valuable way to demonstrate your competency with technical frameworks, if you don't have relevant professional experience, and also demonstrates initiative. When adding projects, if you can, link the repository it's hosted on (ensuring it's public), and any websites they're linked to. Once again, if you can, use the X-Y-Z formula if you can find any impact, for instance, speeding up a slow process, helping students, or making the action point qualitative. Demonstrating your skills in a variety of ways, including showing you've brought the application to production, published it on the internet, and so on are good ways of solidifying the work you've done.


### Skills 

The skills section is a little more contested for its value, primarily since collections of words don't convey much meaning, and you can often expand upon technical skills in the other sections. Nonetheless, I highly discourage stating soft skills such as "communication", "teamwork", "team player", and "hard-working" as they convey nothing, and a recruiter will inevitably test you on that in a behavioural interview.

### Achievements

If you have a lot of achievements, it may be worth creating a new section, briefly outlining each achievement, and what the achievement is for. For instance, if you won a scholarship for academic results, briefly state the scholarship is awarded to students who maintain a certain grade. 

## Conclusion

This article was split off from the other articles, as it doesn't really belong in the candidate advice section, but is also significant enough to warrant its own `.5` ~~Final Mix, 358/2 days~~ section. As I've previously mentioned, I'd be happy to vet resumes if you DM me. The next article will talk about the various interview formats, and how to best approach different interview assessments. In summary, keep your resume concise, and ensure that every point contributes to your potential as a candidate for the job you're applying for.

### More Resume Advice

As I previously mentioned, writing a resume inevitably becomes subjective, and you should consult a variety of sources on what your resume could include. I have listed some resources below. Some of these articles may provide advice that contradicts each other, but that's inevitable when you scrutinise a resume. Alternatively, you could disregard all of my advice, and try your hand at tailoring a resume from scratch!
