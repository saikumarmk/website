# HECS and CSP explained

Congrats! You're a fresh university student, who has likely chosen a course on a coin flip, with regrets, yet to come. Before you spend years transferring universities because it's "practically free", have a look at this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/y2eixt/borrowing_power_limited_due_to_hecs/), or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/10fnsdv/crippled_by_hecs_debt_will_take_a_lifetime_to_pay/).


## What is HECS?

The HECS-HELP loan is an initiative that pays for your studies. Then, when you start earning over around 50,000 (exact figure varying), an amount will be deducted to pay back your loan. No free university :(


A lot of people will tell you that HECS is "interest-free", and yes, it is true. But, every year, you will accrue an indexation fee to "account for the cost of living", in other words, inflation. And unfortunately, if you've seen the price of eggs, we're living in inflation-heavy times. 


In short, if you have around 120k in debt from say, a law + arts double degree at Monash, with 3.9% indexation, you'll be paying off around $4680 on top of your principal (the amount you borrowed). It's worth noting that a lot of humanities units now cost around $1800 per unit, so each year, you will accrue around $14,440 in debt alone. If you think this is unfair, [go take it up with the clowns who thought this was a good idea](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/19/australian-university-fees-arts-stem-science-maths-nursing-teaching-humanities). 

So, the moral of the story? University is no longer free, and it can bite you in the ass.


## What's CSP?

A commonwealth-supported position, or CSP for short, is a spot at a university where you pay less per unit, as the government covers the rest of it. Before 2021, a lot of units cost around $1000 each, but now, there's an emphasis on STEM/teaching, which means they've become cheaper.

| Contribution Band | Maximum Contribution Amount (per EFTSL) | Approximate Cost per Unit |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Band 4: Law, accounting, administration, economics, commerce, communications, society and culture | $14,630 | $1,828.75 |
| Band 3: Dentistry, medicine, veterinary science | $11,401 | $1,425.13 |
| Band 2: Computing, other health, allied health, visual and performing arts, built environment, engineering, science, environmental studies, surveying, professional pathway psychology, professional pathway social work, pathology | $8,021 | $1,002.63 |
| Band 1: Agriculture, English, mathematics, statistics, education, clinical psychology, foreign languages, nursing | $3,985 | $498.13 |

In case you think mathematics is the least employable major, traders at Jane Street start with a salary that is at least AUD 600K. 


It's worth noting that at an undergraduate level if you're a domestic student, there is a very good (nearly certain) chance that you are in a CSP spot. However, CSP opportunities are limited, especially at the postgraduate level, and not all institutions offer CSP by default, meaning you may have to pay the full domestic fee. This is common for medicine and dentistry students who may have to pay the full fee for their course.


## Even more conditions

From 2022 onwards, you are allowed a lifetime amount of 7 full-time years of university. Any more, and you will pay the full domestic fee. In addition, there is a completion rate requirement, which means that if you don't pass at least 50 per cent of the units you have attempted, then you will have to pay the full-fee rate until you get that completion rate back up.


## Moral of the story

If you can afford to, take university seriously. If you don't believe you can take 4 units a semester (eww, trimesters), then underload, and either compensate by doing summer units or extending your degree. You could switch to doing university part-time if required, and that will only count for half a full-time year (in short, it's more complicated than that).
