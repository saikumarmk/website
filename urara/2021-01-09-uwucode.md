# An esoteric toy programming language

uwucode is an interpreted programming languaged coded in Rust and boasts ridiculous keywords that derive from recent pop-culture. While the language itself may be satirical and impractical to use, it conveys simple aspects of language design in a beginner friendly manner, something of interest to a variety of programmers. I will eventually do a write-up on what I consider is the preliminary essence of language design, and my thought process while designing uwucode. You may find an overview of uwucode over here [https://theorvolt.github.io/uwucode/](https://theorvolt.github.io/uwucode/) and the github page here [https://github.com/Theorvolt/uwucode](https://github.com/Theorvolt/uwucode).
