# Companies and the timeline

## Introduction

Welcome to The Grad/Intern Playbook! This is a set of articles written by me, documenting my thoughts on how to make it through the technology industry in Australia as a university student. I'm Sai, the current president of the Monash Association of Coding (MAC), and a future Machine Learning Engineer at Canva, an infographic design company. Throughout university, I discovered the many, many details of the technical interview process, and how to best prepare for it.


### Preface
Before you read further, this will be an extremely opinionated article that will be somewhat to the point and won't be vague. So, if you've got an eye for making real big bucks out of university (in Australia), here's my guide to software engineering as a university student in Australia. This will also be split into multiple parts, with the first part being an introduction to some of the bigger companies in Australia, and the timeline for when you apply to these companies.

### What do you want out of tech?

While a lot of people are interested in the tech industry, or technical roles because it pays handsomely out of university, there's quite a few intermediate steps to getting a coveted role that pays over $100,000 fresh out of university, and that the amount of people who do make this much are a small minority. Sure, it may be possible for someone who does no self-guided work in their spare time to get one of these roles, but it's not likely, especially when there are countless candidates who are actively maximising their probability of getting in. Realistically, you won't stand as much of a chance if you don't enjoy the process of programming, and it would be wise to consider what you want out of the degree you're doing.

## The targets

Before you get ahead of yourself and aim for the Big 4 consulting firms because you've heard they're prestigious, let's discuss technical roles. Technology companies are driven primarily by their software and usually pay the most, but there are also quantitative trading firms, that hire software engineers to work, which are classified as finance. Companies whose primary product isn't tech, such as banks, accounting firms, supermarket chains, and so on generally don't pay as much, but have more lenient technical processes (on average).

- Tech and Quantiative trading firms have harder interviews on average.
- Non-tech companies who hire developers may have interviews completely unrelated to what you have studied, e.g psychometric testing, case studies, etc

More information on the interview processes in a following part.

### Big Tech

Unfortunately, we don't have as many options when it comes to big tech companies that have an office here. Nonetheless, there are a few companies that have an office in Sydney or are expanding out with satellite offices in other states. These companies are considered tech because their primary function is selling tech-based products. At the end of each company is **I** for an internship, and **G** for graduate roles, with **?** indicating uncertainty.



- Atlassian: A software company that develops collaboration and productivity software, including Jira and Confluence. **(I,G)**
- Canva: An online graphic design platform that allows users to create a variety of designs, from social media posts to business cards. I interned here as an MLE and will return as a graduate ML engineer. **(I,G)**
- Google: While not an Australian company, Google has a significant presence in Australia and employs many software developers in the country. **(I,G?)**
- Amazon: Consists of Amazon, and AWS, a subsidiary that hires software engineers. **(I,G)**
Airwallex: A fintech company providing cross-border payment solutions for businesses. **(I,G)**
Rokt: A marketing tech company specializing in personalized offers at the point of transaction to improve e-commerce customer engagement and conversion rates. **(I??,G)**
- Afterpay: A payment platform that allows users to buy now and pay later, with no interest or fees. **(?)**
- Bukalapak: An Indonesian e-commerce company that operates an online marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of a variety of products, from electronics to fashion to home goods. **(G)**
- SEEK: A job search website that allows users to search for jobs in a variety of industries and locations. **(G?)**
- WiseTech Global: A logistics software company that provides solutions for the logistics industry. **(I?,G)**
- REA Group: A digital advertising company that operates property websites such as realestate.com.au and realcommercial.com.au. **(G)**
- Snap Inc.: A camera and social media company that operates the popular Snapchat app, as well as other products like Spectacles (smart glasses) and Bitmoji (personalized avatar app). **(I,G)**
- TikTok: A social media platform that allows users to create and share short-form videos set to music or audio snippets. The app has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly among younger generations, and has spawned many viral trends and challenges.



This list is nowhere near exhaustive as well and is a curation of some I have taken note of. As for the pay,  you'll have to find that yourself, as it will vary from year to year, and from company to company. But some of the top companies here pay a minimum of 100K, so it is definitely good money.



### Quantitative trading firms

A list of firms that I'm aware of includes Optiver **(I,G)**, IMC **(I,G)**, Akuna Capital **(I,G)**, SIG **(I,G)**, Jump Trading **(?)**, VivCourt **(G)**, Citadel Securities **(I,G)**, and Tibra Capital **(I)**. Jane Street is based in Hong Kong but also takes students from Australian universities. To my knowledge, all of these firms pay over $100,000 for a graduate developer role.

The general consensus with these firms is that you're more confident with your coding skills, perhaps after a stint in competitive programming. Some, but not all of these firms also prefer people with Java/C++ experience, so for more flexibility, consider looking into learning one of these languages. There's also conflicting word about whether these firms want a high WAM/ATAR student. From my own experience, these get asked for at the application stage, and I've seen events where having a high WAM/ATAR is a requirement, but I've also heard of students with one, or neither of them who've got through, so your mileage may vary.

These firms also place a heavy emphasis on not requiring a background in finance, though it helps to have a basic idea of financial instruments, which many of these places have videos detailing. If your intentions are to make as much money out of university, then you should highly consider these companies, as Jane Street touts a first-year graduate total compensation of $700,000.

### Other places

Then there are more companies below, that may be worth considering. This list will likely be continually updated.

- Quantium: A data analytics and AI company serving finance, retail, and healthcare industries. Offers advanced analytics for data-driven decisions. **(G)**
- Carsales.com.au: A digital advertising company that operates automotive classifieds websites such as carsales.com.au and bikesales.com.au. **(G)**
- Telstra: A telecommunications and media company that provides a range of services, including mobile and internet services, television, and streaming. **(I,G)**
- Macquarie: An Australian investment bank that offers a range of financial services including asset management, advisory, and banking. Their technology division works on developing innovative solutions to support the bank's operations and services.
- Big 4 banks: This would be Westpac, CBA, ANZ and NAB. The experience varies wildly from team to team.


The big 4 consulting firms (KPMG, EY, Deloitte, PwC) are also options to consider if you don't have many other options. There are many things people say about them; high churn rate, low pay in exchange for a lot of training, not the best if you're interested in tech, and so on.

- It's often common to renege (go back on) on a company if you've received a better offer. While I don't endorse reneging constantly, as you may be blacklisted for doing so, it's important to not feel locked down to a company whose offer you accepted early on, this is your career after all.

## The timeline

Students typically do three or four-year degrees, whether it's a standard degree, a double degree, or an honours degree. The penultimate year is referred to as the year before your final year, and this is typically when you apply for internships. If you're unsuccessful, you can always apply for graduate roles in your final year.


### Does the university matter?

Yes, and no. Some places have tiers for universities for hiring, which are commonly known as target schools. However, this seems less common in Australia when looking at tech companies. Some quantitative trading companies may have a preference for universities within the group of 8:

- University of Melbourne (UniMelb)
- Australian National University (ANU)
- University of Sydney (USYD)
- University of New South Wales (UNSW)
- University of Queensland (UQ)
- Monash University (Monash)
- University of Western Australia (UWA)
- University of Adelaide (UA)

But as to whether it truly matters? It may matter, but it's not the primary consideration for many companies.


### Degree differences

It's worth noting that broadly, your degree doesn't matter to a recruiter, so long as it's STEM-related. Hell, some roles don't even need a STEM degree. You could do computer science, and engineering and major in mechatronics/software engineering, IT in software development, science majoring in computational science, and so on. It doesn't make too much of a difference, except for a few useful core units. With that being said, some courses are much more useful than others. An example of this would be doing applied data science at Monash, compared to data science in computer science, also at Monash. Some other examples I can think of are:

- The Monash computer science (CS) and software engineering (SE) degrees have a compulsory data structures and algorithms unit, whereas IT does not

- The applied data science (ADS) degree goes into depth regarding machine learning, whereas the data science specialisation leaves room for improvement

- The Monash SE, IT, and CS degrees all have the IBL program*, whereas science degrees do not

- The SE degree has a compulsory honours year, whereas CS has an optional honours year, and IT has no such honours year

- A double degree in science/computer science majoring in mathematics will have more space for math as opposed to computer science on its own 

There are many intricacies to what your degree is, but the end result isn't too important, as long you put the effort in your spare time. This guide will follow a four-year course, but you can still follow the advice as usual anyway, as the timeline would just be a year shorter. 

### Getting more chances/University progression

Some students utilise longer degrees to get more chances for internships. A common example would be doing a double degree, where you have two penultimate years, by first considering an alternative exit where you drop a degree, or by finishing both degrees. Underloading is also a viable option, as there's no rush to complete your degree. Some companies will auto-reject you based on your prospective graduation date, so you could change this to account for dropping a degree/honours year. 

My personal opinion is that three years is awfully short for someone with no prior coding ability to become competent enough, though it's possible assuming you do a bunch of development in your spare time. I've heard advice from others regarding underloading/overloading, and the general consensus is that it's totally fine to underload, as 4 units, while managing other commitments or working towards a career can be very daunting. There's genuinely no rush to finish early, as you'll be less prepared for whatever comes after.

- I personally don't endorse this, but you can also fake a penultimate year, to stack multiple internships. What you get out of this is beyond me, other than getting a feel for where you want to go.


### First year 

There are a few places that offer pre-penultimate internships but are not common. This would be the Google STEP program and Optivers internships. The Google STEP program is conflicting on who can enter, as there were years were it was entirely women, but have heard otherwise from Google employees.

Some other programs that may be of note include:

- IMC launchpad: A short experience that could get you fast-tracked to the final round of an IMC internship in the following year
- Akuna's winter internship
- Big 4 insight programs

Nonetheless, you shouldn't be concerned if you haven't found an internship in your first year. It's pretty exceptional if you do!


My personal advice would be to really drill down on your programming classes, as they will evolve in difficulty. Now, another aspect should be learning about different fields in programming. The introductory courses teach Python or C, which are good languages, but don't scratch the surface if you're interested in web development, or some other field. Some suggestions include:

- Learn another language (Java, C++, Rust, JavaScript)
- Learn a framework for the above languages
- Attempt a personal project
- Get involved with club events
- Talk with people!

If your goal is to aim for the big leagues, you can maximise your odds by doing this sort of stuff early on. The things you'll need to focus on are covered in the second article. An understated part of the internship/graduate grind is talking to other people, as you'll get a much better idea of what you want to do, what you want to aim for, and what you should be doing.

My personal recommendation is also becoming familiar with clubs/societies at your university. For Monash, this would be:

- Monash Association of Coding (MAC): We run technical events on upskiling yourself and getting into the industry
- MonSec: A cybersecurity club that runs workshops on the cybersecurity field, such as penetration testing, reverse engineering, cryptography, OSINT, and so on. They run weekly workshops and participate in CTFs (Capture The Flag)
- WIRED (FITS): The faculty official society, which is concerned with social events, technical events, and various other broadly IT related activities.
- Commerce and Computing Association (CCA): A club that blends commerce and computing, (with the intersection usually being tech consulting). They run more social/networking related events.
- Monash Deep Neuron (MDN): An engineering student team that focuses on deep learning and high powered computing. Student teams are more involved, as you'll be trained in the field, and then work on a project during your time there.
- Monash Algorithms and Problem Solving Society (MAPS): A student team focused on competitive programming, with weekly workshops on various competitive programming topics. I'd recommend this if you have an interest in the more competitive companies.

As for how much involvement you should aim for, that's a matter of choice. You can rock up to most of the events/workshops these clubs run, and talk to the regulars/committee members to learn more, or you could become a committee member yourself, which is definitely a positive on a resume.

### Second year

You will have likely completed a few computer science units at this point, however, whether you will have completed the first algorithms and data structures course depends on your university. Monash and UniMelb only do this in the first semester of Y2, whereas it may be different with UNSW's trimesters. Assuming you've participated in club activities, and done some programming in your first year, now it's time to start drilling down on some of the interview-specific skills, and honing your general ability.

Two invaluable outlets for students through the university would be tutoring their introductory units, or research assistant work. Teaching students how to write code is invaluable experience, and reinforces your own ability, as it is often considered a higher form of understanding. A research assistant also exposes you to research topics in computer science/technology, which gives you a topic to talk about in interviews, in addition to getting paid.

Overall, I'd recommend doing the following:

- Attend any networking nights that societies advertise
- Start looking into Leetcode, and consider the Blind75/Neetcode150 set of problems
- Continue working on any personal projects you may have
- Participate in a hackathon with friends

So, by the end of the year, you're comfortable writing code in two languages, have experiences to discuss in interviews, and can nail a coding assessment. I personally did this through the second year, and did leetcode every day for a month straight, in the summer of my third year. I also did a research program in deep learning over the summer to continually hone my skills.

### Third year /  Penultimate year

By the time you've reached your penultimate year, you will have had quite an amount of experience from clubs, writing code in your own time, hackathons, research, tutoring, or perhaps a pre-penultimate internship. The goal is now to smash your internship interviews so that you'll be set for the summer. The big tech companies release their internship applications between January and March, and quantitative trading firms follow a similar timeline. Other companies may open up later on, for instance, CBA opened in August. Regardless


#### Addendum A - Summer

Congrats! You've landed a summer internship, but it's not quite over. Typically, companies hire interns as a cheap method to scout out graduate talent and give them return offers to get them on board early. However, in recent years, with a rough market, the headcount at various companies has shrunk, or frozen, meaning that you may have to work to impress during your internship. As a result, the intern to graduate conversion offers have decreased. Some of my tips during the internship would include:

- Establishing a good relationship between you, and your host/supervisor, which includes regular communication on the project, participating in standups and so on
- Try to finish your project, or get it to a state that you can talk about.




#### Addendum B - Course Placements

At Monash, there is an industry-based learning (IBL) program that lets you do an internship for around 6 months. You get paid around $19,000 in the form of a scholarship, instead of completing a computer science project. These are primarily companies in Melbourne, and the work can vary from making slides to proper development. Where you end up depends on your performance in the interviews, and luck.

Assuming normal progression, the IBL placement is done at the start of your third year, replacing the computer science project. The internship starts in late january, meaning it may conflict with any summer internships, if you're in a 3 year degree.

As for whether this is worth it, that once again depends on what you make of the opportunity. While it is below minimum wage, you are gaining invaluable experience that can be hard to come across. On the flip side, if you were confident in your abilities to secure your own internship, then go ahead, however you'll have to complete a project based unit instead.


### Fourth year / Final year

The last year of university can be daunting when it comes to application


### Conclusion - Part 1

There is so much to note when it comes to landing a role in the tech industry as a university student. I intend to split this into four parts as follows:

- Part 1 - The timeline
- Part 2 - Becoming a better candidate
- Part 3 - The resume
- Part 4 - Tackling the interview process

To summarise this article, actively work to learn more about the industry, programming, talk to lots of people, and participate in events throughout university. If you're interested in learning more, you can always reach out to me :)
