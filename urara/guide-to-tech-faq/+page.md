I've received many questions on my article, so this page will act as an index for the most popular questions, and the answers to them.


### Links to each article

### What opportunities are available?

My society, MAC also maintains a job board [which can be found here](https://monashcoding.notion.site/MAC-x-Tech-Internships-ca8d669bec6249b99f5b41cd68e83027) and we're actively working to catalogue internships, who they're available to, and what working rights you need. Aside from that, [this section from the first article](../guide-to-tech-1/#the-targets) also covers a range of companies and job posting sites.

### What if I'm not penultimate?

The answer is complex, but there are less opportunities. [See this section in the first article for a non-comprehensive list](../guide-to-tech-1/#first-year). The internship/graduate job board maintained by MAC also lists if an internship accepts pre-penultimate students.

### Where can I find information on making a resume?

[In my 2.5 article](../guide-to-tech-2.5/), where I list my (opinionated) choice of resume which is [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs).

### I'm a penultimate student, what do I do?
