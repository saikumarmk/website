I've received many questions on my article, so this page will act as an index for the most popular questions, and the answers to them.

### What opportunities are available?

My society, MAC also maintains a job board [which can be found here](https://monashcoding.notion.site/MAC-x-Tech-Internships-ca8d669bec6249b99f5b41cd68e83027) and we're actively working to catalogue internships, who they're available to, and what working rights you need. Aside from that, [this section from the first article](../guide-to-tech-1/#the-targets) also covers a range of companies and job posting sites. [AusJobs/Australia-Tech-Internship](https://github.com/AusJobs/Australia-Tech-Internship) also has a collection of Australian internships with the date they open.

### What if I'm not penultimate?

The answer is complex, but there are less opportunities. [See this section in the first article for a non-comprehensive list](../guide-to-tech-1/#first-year). The internship/graduate job board maintained by MAC also lists if an internship accepts pre-penultimate students. You are also free to ponder any less honest ideas, such as pretending you're a penultimate student when you're really not.

### Where can I find information on making a resume?

[In my 2.5 article](../guide-to-tech-2.5/), where I list my (opinionated) choice of resume which is [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs).

### Why is your spelling of resume inconsistent?

To piss off the one person who would say "umm ackshually, it's résumé 🤓".

### I'm a penultimate student, what do I do?

[See my first article.](../guide-to-tech-1/#third-year---penultimate-year)


### How do I rizz the recruiters?

What?

### What do you gain by doing all of this?

Nothing, really~~, other than potential referrals~~. I'm invested in bringing out the potential in people, and I've also found that I often have to repeat myself when giving advice to others, so I may as well collate it here. Another reason is that I'm cursed with all this knowledge, and want to note it down somewhere, so I may as well format it.

### On Natural Talent versus Hard work

I'm a firm believer of 70-80% of your ability coming through hard work. Some people may learn stuff instantly, or be able to solve problems instantly, but the only person you should seriously compare yourself to is you. Being diligient and resilient is hard, but are amazing traits to have in your life, so even if you feel like nothing is going your way, continue to push on. Don't just push on as you normally do though, actively challenge yourself, your assumptions about the way you learn if you feel it's ineffective, and really fight the content placed in front of you.
