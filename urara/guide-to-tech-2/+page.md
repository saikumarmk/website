## Introduction

This is the second article of four articles in my series. The previous article covers the timeline associated with internships and graduate programs. So, how do you maximise your odds of landing a role? The obvious answer is to be the best candidate possible, but how would you do that?

There are broadly four major areas of development for a candidate, whether it's contributing to what you can talk about, or something you list on a resume they would be:

- Experience
- Volunteering
- Projects
- Academics

With each ordered by (relative) importance. We'll explore each area, but it's worth noting that **you don't need stuff in each area** and that two to three areas suffice. This concept is borrowed (somewhat shamelessly) from Nick Lambourne's [Getting that Grad/Intern Role article](https://blog.ndl.im/getting-that-grad-or-intern-position/#the-four-axes) but really captures the broadest distinct criteria that you can undertake to improve your worth as a candidate. It's also worth noting that some companies (anecdotally) favour one area over another (e.g. having prior work experience), but the specifics elude most people, and I'd focus on maximising your worth as a candidate across the board. 

### My Personal Path

One thing I'd also drive home is that everyone's path through university is (mostly) unique and that you can end up at the same place by following different paths. In my case, I tutored VCE mathematics in my first year, while working on a few personal projects that I was interested in. In my second year, I joined MAC as an events officer and worked to develop SETool, a web application for comparing university scores, and at the end of my second year, I did summer research in deep learning. In my third year, I participated in UniHACK and was the events director of MAC, and did winter research in game theory, before becoming the president of MAC, and finally interning at Canva as an MLE. Some other people I know have chosen to underload to work, focusing on gaining professional experience, or perhaps doing IBL, then getting into more interesting places after IBL. 

## Experience

Being able to list prior relevant work is a huge plus, but it's not the end of the world if you don't have that. Most internships don't require you to have 20 years of experience, as an internship is meant to introduce you to the workplace in a meaningful manner. That being said, some places are very competitive, and because they have a large pool of highly qualified candidates to select from, they may only filter interns with experience.

### Tutoring and Research Assistant Roles

While you're in university, the opportunity to tutor may arise, as a TA for a subject you've taken before, which usually is a result of having done well in the unit. TA'ing can be time-consuming, as you may be required to mark assignments, but allows you to hone your teaching skills, and talk about how you approach teaching in an interview.

As for research assistant roles, Monash offers winter and summer research programs, where you work with a professor on a project that usually contributes to some form of research. If you have an interest in academia, I'd especially encourage applying. Even if you don't have a research interest, the work you do can vary wildly and can give you an idea of what you'd like to work on in the future. For Monash, you're allowed up to three preferences, and 500 words on why you'd be a good choice for any three of your projects, which is a bit stupid, considering the projects you chose could be different. I believe there is some element of luck to these positions, as many people may apply for one project, but the choice inevitably comes down to the most convincing written application, if the researcher hasn't planned to interview all candidates.

The research projects vary in pay and hours, but they tend to not be full-time work (normally), and you'll be communicating with a researcher frequently, to give status updates and see how the direction of the project is progressing. There's no harm in applying, and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't get a position, as there are many other opportunities to apply for the research programs. It's also worth noting that sometimes, researchers may reach out to you since they're interested in what you've written to offer your project, which happened in the case of me and a friend. Having an academic reference is also immensely useful if you wish to apply for postgraduate programs, or need a reference for a job application.


### IBL 

As Monash offers the IBL program to anyone studying IT/CS/SE in Eng, you can receive a 6-month placement, with a payment of about $20,000 (below minimum wage, in case you want to run the numbers, but it's technically a scholarship). From memory, the IBL is undertaken in your third year at university, with the placement beginning in January. For this reason, there may be a clash between a summer internship and the IBL program if you do a three-year course. The IBL program is best explained by attending the IBL seminars, but you interview a range of companies, who then score you based on how much they like you, and finally, you are either given a placement or are removed from the program. These internships can vary wildly, with some of my friends being tasked to make slides for a couple of months, to actual projects with an impact on the organization they've been assigned to. I don't have a strong consensus on this program, primarily because it can get in the way of a summer internship which may be more worthwhile (especially if you're interested in the bigger companies), but is also a safer option for securing an internship, while not having to do the project unit you'd normally do. Whatever you choose should come down to your risk tolerance, and the factors I've mentioned before.

### Other Internships

Some other places may offer part-time work or internships, for instance, NAB offers the 6 to 12-month technology internship where you work 4 to 5 days a week at NAB. A common pathway I've seen with regards to a program like this is that you can underload during a chosen year to intern at NAB, which gives you exposure to technology while reaping various benefits such as certifications and connections, at which point you'll be more prepared for summer internship applications at the more reputable companies. If you're not in a hurry to finish university and want to focus on the experience section, I would have a think about finding opportunities for part-time work, as many smaller companies don't care as much about you being a student.

## Volunteering

As I mentioned in the first article, club and student team involvement is seen as an effective method of gaining connections to break into the industry, or gain leadership skills that you can discuss in interviews.

### Club/Society/Team Involvement

These are some of the IT clubs and student teams at Monash:

- Monash Association of Coding (MAC): We run technical events on upskilling yourself and getting into the industry, for instance, topics in Machine Learning, building an application, or learning about frameworks.
- MONSEC: A cybersecurity club that runs workshops on the cybersecurity field, such as penetration testing, reverse engineering, cryptography, OSINT, and so on. They run weekly workshops and participate in CTFs (Capture The Flag)
- WIRED (FITS): The faculty's official society, which is concerned with social events, technical events, and various other broadly IT-related activities.
- Commerce and Computing Association (CCA): A club that blends commerce and computing (with the intersection usually being tech consulting). They run more social/networking-related events.
- Monash Deep Neuron (MDN): An engineering student team that focuses on deep learning and high-powered computing. Student teams are more involved, as you'll be trained in deep learning or high-power computing, and then work on a project during your time there.
- Monash Algorithms and Problem Solving (MAPS): A student team focused on competitive programming, with weekly workshops on various competitive programming topics. I'd recommend this if you have an interest in the more competitive companies.
- Monash Data Science Society (MDSS): A student club that is under the Monash Graduate Association (MGA) which is focused on data science.

So where should you go? The student teams generally have more commitment, as you'll be expected to contribute towards long-running projects in addition to training and workshops, but also help contribute towards projects that you may list on your resume. MDN looks for people in the field of ML/DL or high-performance computing (HPC), so if your interests lie there, I'd put in an application when they're recruiting. The other IT student teams excluding MAPS are less known to me, and are newer, so you can find out more about them [here](https://www.monash.edu/it/student-teams). If you're interested in competitive programming or problem-solving, I highly encourage joining MAPS, which at this time includes running regular workshops on problem-solving.

As for student societies, there's less commitment, as each club endeavours to achieve the purposes enshrined in their respective constitutions. CCA and WIRED lean towards being social clubs, however still feature sponsored workshops that are technical on occasion, whereas MONSEC and MAC are focused on technical skills primarily. If you're interested in cybersecurity, I highly recommend MONSEC, and if you're interested in helping the community by delivering technical workshops, then have a look at MAC.




### Networking

Quite a few students use referrals to increase their chances of getting a role, but what does a referral do? Simply put, if you're working at a company and know someone who would be a great fit for the role, you can refer them, which gives a signal to the recruiter that is at the very least, better than applying without a reference. Should your friend get the role, you would then receive a bonus for the successful referral.

The signal I mentioned can vary from company to company; some companies skip a stage of the process, and sometimes, it guarantees your resume will be seen, or it may have no effect (but they won't tell you that). Nonetheless, if you have a few companies that you're really adamant about getting into, you can find potential referees by:

- Cold calling people on LinkedIn, though I personally recommend sending an invite that conveys interest and intrigue
- Talking to society members; they tend to have done internships at places you may be interested, or may know people who have
- Hanging out on a Discord server - you tend to find a lot of people lurking around

With Canva, I chose to apply without any references and got the role, so it's by no means a necessity but can help your nerves if you're not too sure about your resume. The referee also a bonus if you get in (the amount varies wildly), so it's worth remembering that employees have an incentive for referring you. The other benefit to networking is that you're able to discover what the company does, or anything noteworthy that you can later use in an interview to impress your interviewers or give them a signal that you've done your research on this company.

## Projects

In place of prior experience, many students opt for the tried and tested approach of developing projects on the side, because it shows that you can take initiative, and is a way of contextualising potential skills you've acquired. I often get the question of where you find a project, which is pretty hard to answer. I can think of a couple of sources:

- Hackathons: See below.
- Subject Projects: You may work in a team to develop something that can be published and refined after you complete it
- Personal interest: Finding a problem you want to solve, or something you want to do is often the best sort of project you can do
- Research Assistant work: This is basically an internship, but with the university, and may/may not be open source

### Hackathons

Hackathons are competitions, where you and a teamwork to build and pitch a product, typically over a short time frame, such as 48 hours.


Some of the hackathons that run include:

- UniHack
- HackAustralia
- MedHack
- Hackiethon

You can find a list of hackathons [at hackathonsaustralia](https://www.hackathonsaustralia.com/past-hackathons). A lot of the time, the winning prizes of these hackathons tend to be web applications, which can be hard, if not impossible to do as a first year, if you're not familiar with web development. So, what's my advice for hackathons? There's a lot I'd love to talk about, but I may relegate this to a workshop, or another article, as there are many strategies and launch pads that you could employ. 

The most important thing I've gained from hackathons is the experience of working with your teammates, because there will be many situations where you may disagree with some implementations, or have differing views. That way, you'll have many stories that you can talk about in behavioural interviews, or mould around to answer behavioural questions. Additionally, being able to talk about specific details such as implementation, and what you could have added provides very interesting talking points.


### Personal Projects

My main point to drive here is that you shouldn't force yourself to do a personal project if you don't have any interest in what you're doing. If you do have something in mind you want to build, don't shy away from it. Some common starting grounds for projects include building your own website if you're a front-end developer, building a discord bot, a full-stack data science dashboard, or a web application for a problem you're interested in building. I'd recommend using a large language model such as ChatGPT to learn how to tackle a project, including learning the relevant technologies, what steps you'd need to take, and making a timeline for development.

Another reason I suggest embarking on a personal project is that you learn faster by writing code and grappling with how different libraries work.

## Leetcode / Competitive Programming

A major aspect of the tech industry is the culture around the technical interview, popularised by Google, and then adopted by everyone in town. While many Reddit posts exaggerate the number of LeetCode problems solved without a FAANG offer, grinding out competitive programming problems and LeetCode helps mainly with the online assessment (OA). There is a degree to which it will help in the technical interview, however, the technical interview is more of a demonstration of your [communication skills (sometimes called coachability), ability to test code, and problem-solve](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-rubrics/), not just how quickly you solve the problem. 

Despite saying that, I still recommend doing either the [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) as supplementary material to your data structures and algorithms course, or alternatively gradually working on the [NeetCode 150 roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). I recommend these problem sets because you will become more familiar with approaching problems in an OA. In addition, you should engage in mock technical interviews where you either explain how to solve the problem and implement it.

Now, if you want to truly go the distance and be competitive when solving these problems, I recommend diving into the world of competitive programming. A modest introduction to competitive programming would be through your local competitive programming club, which in the case of Monash would be the [Monash Algorithms and Problems Solving Club (MAPS)](https://discord.gg/r825Qmk2D2), by attending their workshops and attempting problems posed by them. From here, you should try your hand at the weekly Leetcode contests, or perhaps Codeforces, if you feel like destroying your sleep cycle. When it comes to learning problem-solving techniques, the goal is to progress with problems that challenge you and consolidate your understanding when you need a new technique to solve a problem.

## Academics

The importance of your grade is widely contested, and I would still argue that it doesn't matter past the screening stage in exceptional circumstances, as some places use your weighted average mark (WAM) as a cheap filter. 


Anecdotally though, I've heard of companies that may look through your academic transcript, and question your grades. My personal advice is to do your best, but don't feel discouraged from applying if your grades aren't the highest. In the case that your WAM is notable, and you've got a commendation such as the Dean's honour list, definitely put that down on your resume. Some companies may also select you (at the resume stage) based on a high WAM, but these are, again, a few finance firms, and not the majority.

Not sure what counts as a strong ATAR, but oh well...



## Conclusion - Part 2

![Spider-man PS$, Be Greater](/assets/guide-to-tech/be_greater.jpg)

Whenever you feel like holding back from an opportunity because you don't feel you can do it, remember [some say self-doubt is an invitation to be greater, this is your opportunity to prove it.](https://youtu.be/q4GdJVvdxss?t=61) Originally, I was to add a section on resume writing, however, felt that it deserved its own section, and will feature in the next article, which is Part 2.5 ~~Final Mix~~, Curating your resume. I want to emphasise that there is no one golden path that sits above the rest, as everyone has different interests, and that you should try everything before settling into something that works for you.
