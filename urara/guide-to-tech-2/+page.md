# Part 2 - Making yourself a better candidate

This is the second article of four articles on my series. The previous article covers the timeline associated with internships and graduate programs. So, how do you maximise your odds of landing a role? The obvious answer is to be the best candidate possible, but how would you do that?

### The importance of a resume

It's worth noting that you should be actively bettering your odds as a candidate, not just as the resume screen stage, but at the various interview stages. Once your resume gets screened, and you are chosen, then it typically has no impact on your final outcome, only your interview performance does. Everything on this list will, in some way affect your performance in the later rounds, for instance talking about work you've done as part of a society, or a personal project will be crucial for the behaviroal stage.

### The inconsistency of recruiting

I've received quite an amount of conflicting advice on resumes, and what recruiters are looking for. Spending enough time talking to recruiters across different companies has made me realise that what they look for in a resume will vary from company to company, and from recruiter to recruiter. 

### The ATS

The Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is used for managing job applications, from start to finish. The most common context you'll hear the ATS is filtering out resumes, perhaps for not containing relevant keywords.

## Projects

In place of prior experience, many students opt for the tried and tested approach of developing projects on the side, because it shows that you can take initiative, and is a way of conextualising potential skills you've acquired. I often get the question of where you find a project from, which is pretty hard to answer. I can think of a couple of sources:

- Hackathons: See below.

- Subject Projects: You may work in a team to develop something that can be published and refined after you complete it

- Personal interest: Finding a problem you want to solve, or something you want to do is often the best sort of project you can do

- Research Asssistant work: This is basically an internship, but with the university, and may/may not be open source.

### Hackathons



Hackathons are competitions, where you and a team work to build and pitch a product, typically over a short time-frame, such as 48 hours.


Some of the hackathons that run include:

- UniHack

- HackAustralia

A lot of the time, the winning prizes of theses hackathons tend to be web applications, which can be hard, if not impossible to do as a first year, if you're not familiar with web development. 

### Personal Projects

## Academics

The importance of your grade is widely contested, and I would still argue that it doesn't matter past the screening stage in exceptional circumstances, as some places use your weighted average mark (WAM) as a cheap filter. 


Anecdotally though, I've heard of companies that may look through your academic transcript, and question your grades. My personal advice is to do your best, but don't feel discouraged from applying if your grades aren't the highest. In the case that your WAM is notable, and you've got a comendation such as the Dean's honour list, definitely put that down on your resume.

## Networking

Quite a few student use referrals to increase their chances of getting a role, but what does a referral do? Simply put, if you're working at a company and know someone who would be a great fit for the role, you can refer them, which gives a signal to the recruiter that is at the very least, better than applying without a reference. Should your friend get the role, you would then receive a bonus for the successful referral.

The signal I mentioned can vary from company to company; some companies skip a stage of the process, sometimes, it guarantees your resume will be seen, or it may have no effect (but they won't tell you that). Nonetheless, if you have a few companies that you're really adamant about getting into, you can find potential referrees by:

- Cold caling people on LinkedIn, though I personally recommend sending an invite that conveys interest and intrigue
- Talking to society members; they tend to have done internships at places you may be interested, or may know people who have
- Hanging out on a Discord server - you tend to find a lot of people lurking around

With Canva, I chose to apply without any references, and got the role, so it's by no means a necessity, but can help your nerves if you're not too sure about your resume.
