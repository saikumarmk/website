## Introduction 

Hello! I'm Sai, and as of writing this article, ~~I'm in my final year of studying at Monash University, specifically in an applied data science honours year~~ I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Canva. In my time at Monash, I rose to become the president of the Monash Association of Coding across three years, and also interned at Canva as a Machine Learning Engineer. My journey through university has been an interesting one, with me meeting many friends, learning many things, and having to deal with tough scenarios. This article will focus on my first three years at university, along with how I got into Canva. 


## Act 1 - Year of Covid

By the time I had finished VCE at the [small school situated within Monash](https://jmss.vic.edu.au/), alerts of a respiratory disease from China had broken out. I had no plans after high school, except from dealing with burn-out from an unnecessarily harsh study timetable.

This year was all online, with no in-person O-week, just straight to Zoom classes. I spent way too much time on tutoring, which effectively became part-time work, though this didn't have too much of an effect on the year, as it was already exhausting. As far as resume related content was concerned, I primarily focused on classes
