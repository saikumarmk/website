Neochomp is an LED Matrix display powered by a single-board computer (SBC), a microcontroller, and the Pixlet library, for rendering GIFs in a 32x64 grid. This is a project done with the help of my friend [Shin](https://seejianshin.com/), an engineering and design student who has made much of this process possible, including the hardware and design process.


The source code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/saikumarmk/neochomp), and blogs on the development of this display will be added.
