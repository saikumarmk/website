Neochomp is an LED Matrix display powered by a single-board computer (SBC), a microcontroller, and the Pixlet library, for rendering GIFs in a 32x64 grid. This is a project done with the help of my friend Shin, an engineering and design student who has made much of this process possible, including the hardware and design process.


The source code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/saikumarmk/neochomp), and blogs on the development of this display will be added.
