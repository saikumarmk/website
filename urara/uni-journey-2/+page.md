## Where we left off

Welcome back! My previous article covered the first three years of university, and my journey of getting into Canva. This second article will cover my fourth year, which is concerned with a series of increasingly absurd events, which can only be described as the hottest political thriller of Monash ~~or maybe not~~. Before we begin, I want to add a disclaimer to not go after any of the individuals, or organizations mentioned in this article. Additionally, I've attempted to remove my personal opinions on individuals, sticking to the fact of the matter. My personal opinion is that each of the clubs bring different things to the table, and that committee work is largely run on volunteering, something anyone should respect. My motivation for writing this article is that it brings a lot of detail onto the prevalence of student politics in Monash, and that to start anew, any chinese whispers should be put to rest.

## A history of Monash IT clubs

Within Monash, there are a range of IT related clubs, and student teams. I've summarised them in previous articles, but I'll once again summarise each society/team:

- Monash Association of Coding (MAC): We run technical events on upskilling yourself and getting into the industry, for instance, topics in Machine Learning, building an application, or learning about frameworks.
- MonSec: A cybersecurity club that runs workshops on the cybersecurity field, such as penetration testing, reverse engineering, cryptography, OSINT, and so on. They run weekly workshops and participate in CTFs (Capture The Flag)
- WIRED (FITS): The faculty's official society, which is concerned with social events, technical events, and various other broadly IT-related activities.
- Commerce and Computing Association (CCA): A club that blends commerce and computing (with the intersection usually being tech consulting). They run more social/networking-related events.
- Monash Deep Neuron (MDN): An engineering student team that focuses on deep learning and high-powered computing. Student teams are more involved, as you'll be trained in deep learning or high-power computing, and then work on a project during your time there.
- Monash Algorithms and Problem Solving Society (MAPS): A student team focused on competitive programming, with weekly workshops on various competitive programming topics. I'd recommend this if you have an interest in the more competitive companies.
- Google Developer Student Club (GDSC): A Monash chapter of GDSC, which focuses on running events on technical frameworks, and careers, with frequent assistance from Google speakers.

Now, it's worth noting that of the **clubs**, MAC is the youngest, being formed in 2019 (When I was in year 12!). MonSec is then the second youngest, forming in 2014, with WIRED being formed in 2008, and CCA, in 2000, which initially came as a shock to me! The IT student teams were a new student team initiative introduced at the start of 2023, and MAPS, which was formerly known as MCPC, became a student team, where it was previously claimed to be under WIRED. WIRED, as of September 2022, approached GDSC for a partnership, but the nature of this partnership is dubious at best, as it was later found that WIRED and GDSC resources were comingled, a major violation of C&S IT policy usage, especially concerning confidential documents. The other clubs have typically worked separate of each other, perhaps with the ocasional collaboration, but it's worth noting that MonSec started as a subcommitteee of WIRED, and eventually branched off and became its' own club. Dilhan unfortunately believes that MonSec should have never separated from WIRED, which would ultimately limit what MonSec can produce.


### WIRED

WIRED, also known as the Faculty of IT Society (FITS) is the faculty official club for IT students. In the past, the club primarily functioned as a society enabling IT students to socialise, with technical events on the side, though the specifics are up to your imagination. Some of their highlights include the IT ball, creating UniHack, and creating MonPlan, so they've definitely had their fair share of great moments. However, there have been countless controversies that have plagued the club, with the largest saga spanning 2022 to 2023. In the past, it was said that a committee member of WIRED (around 2018) took out 9K under the guise of "buying t-shirts", and attempted to run off the cash. They were thrwarted, and were required to repay the amount they took. Around this time, some interpersonal conflicts also arose, and by the time the WIRED OGM had come up in 2019, there was a shadow of influence from student politics that effectively pushed some contenders for GenRep roles out. Without going into the specifics of details, improper management from WIRED led it down a decline. This decline was observed in 2022, where they faced being dregistered due to falling under 100 members, and had also not run any events, which can impact the registration pack application for C&S affiliation.
 
### Birth of MAC

Soon afterwards, MAC would go on to be founded by former WIRED members April, Jord, and Rhea, with a focus on technical skills preparation. You can actually find an introduction to MAC [here](https://medium.com/@monashcoding/we-are-creators-chapter-1-e0aca26a6f0e), but April and some other students gathered each week to work on leetcode problems and whiteboarding in order to prepare for technical interviews.

A most spectacular origin!

From there, MAC rose to popularity, as COVID also hit, and their online workshops made them massively popular across the community. The MAC team at that time adopted to virtual events,

## Re-WIRED

As WIRED faced deregistration in 2022, a small team within the IT @ Monash Discord server took it upon themselves to try and take over WIRED, with a technique called stacking. You get a bunch of your mates, and ask them to vote for you at an election. Keep this in mind, you'll see it quite frequently. At the time,

## Digression - Student Politics

And now to the most gripping part of university; the MSA, and student politics. You may be familiar with the annoying messages you get each year, around September, encouraging you to vote for a party for elections you may barely know about. If you're not familiar with the Monash Student Association (MSA), they're the association that works to better the student experience at university, via events, having support systems, and so on. Below is an MSA organisation chart, which consists of paid staff members, and elected student members. 

![the MSA organization chart](/assets/uni-journey/msa_org.PNG)

The MSA (or part of it) is controlled by the ruling student party, and the elections for these positions typically occur in Spetember. Now, let's talk about the parties involved. As of writing this article, the Together party has been the ruling party, and they're usually marked by pink. This party is known for amassing votes by messaging any contact they have, and has grown to be the party that ensured the academic safety-net policy was passed each time. On another angle, members of this party typically associate with moderates of the Labor party. You may wonder what actual political leanings have to do with student politics, but in effect, the student run political factions have a deep hold on these parties. 

The other viable contender is called Student Voice. They're commonly associated with Labor left, and are considered more progressive with their policies. They're in direct contest with Together, and usually make efforts to decry or point out shortcomings of Together. At some point in 2021, the MSA pushed ammendments to their constitution declaring that:

- Talking to students on campus about the elections would be BANNED
- Printing leaflets or posters for the elections would be BANNED
- Any form of in-person campaigning would mean candidates would be disqualified.

Citing COVID as their reasoning. Whether you choose to believe this reasoning is up for you, but understand that politics, even within a university can be immensely complicated. If you were to ask a Student Voice candidate, they would likely call Together out for their inaction, while claiming that when Student Voice was in power, many changes were brought about. I don't quite wish to contest the specifics of this, so the main takeaway is really to be careful of anyone on a ticket.

### The perversion of student clubs

So, what the hell does student politics have to do with student clubs? It turns out, that in an effort for power, some of these divisions a
