## Introduction

A common theme I've encountered in the questions I've been asked is advice for university, typically from high-school students, or first year university students. Not that you should be discouraged from messaging/emailing me, please do! But I'm writing this as I think it would be very useful for a lot of students as I recall many people in my cohort not truly knowing what they wanted to do. I am always open to messages on more specific stuff, or sense checks in any case.

In any case, I want to preface that my style of writing draws from my own experiences, and those of the many people I've met. I write to paint a detailed picture of what you're getting into, but ultimately offer you the choice to make your own decisions. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to university, and I hope this article helps you navigate your own path. I am also not above making mistakes, or having wrong opinions, so I am always open to discussion! I think there should be giscus comments enabled across the site now for anyone to discuss.

# Part 1: Choosing Your Path

First things first, university is one of the common paths for highschool leavers, though there are other paths, such as apprenticeships, TAFE, or straight into employment. I cannot speak to the other paths, barring blue collar work as much of my family are essentially in some sort of trades (or were). The most common thing you'll hear about this line of work is that it is physically taxing, and often is quite physically demanding, however the pay can be quite good for the work done. 

Okay, suppose you're interested in studying at a university, then what are you ultimately getting out of the experience? 

## 1. Your Course and University

### 1.1 Should You Maximise Your ATAR?

So you're aiming for a high ATAR, that's a good thing! However, do not be fooled by degrees that have very high ATAR entry requirements (barring things like direct entry medicine/dentistry/etc). I can't count the number of students who've taken on Commerce/Computer Science because it was the 'best' use of their ATAR. I'll elaborate on that particular degree combination (it's not bad), but you'll be sorely disappointed to see that it won't really lead to better career outcomes. 

There are good reasons to do a double degree (this is Monash),

### 1.2 What Do You Actually Want to Do?

Most year 12s don't really know what they want to do, mainly because it's hard to know what you're signing up for. Quite a few people who study commerce aren't really aware of the extent of the financial sector in Australia (and even so after graduating). Similarly, somehow you can graduate with a degree in computer science while barely knowing how to code, and so on.

I also want to emphasise the content you learn in high school is not reflective of what you'll do in university. I can speak for physics, mathematics, and programming in particular, but you should keep this in mind.

### 1.3 Which University Should You Pick?

And so we get to the university of choice. Everyone knows of the Group of Eight (Go8) universities - these are the leading *research* universities in Australia. That's right, **research**. In fact, if you've seen university rankings, you'll see that most of these universities are in the top 100, and that's typically based on the research output of the university (along with some consultant-fluffing). The down-line is, you should not treat these rankings as a definitive measure of your experience. 

Some universities excel at certain areas, for instance Monash is reknown for their [pharmacy program](https://www.monash.edu/pharm/about/news/news-listing/latest/monash-university-retains-its-2-global-ranking-for-pharmacy-and-pharmacology), which tends to pad the university reputation as a whole. I personally went with the university closest to me (Monash - a 10 minute drive from me), though I know people who travel from the other side of Melbourne to get to university.

That's not to say some universities aren't better than others for specific courses though - due to disproportiate funding, some universities may have more staff to run more interesting courses for students. As an example, UNSW offers a course on Rust, and an advanced web development class partially taught by people at Canva. Some schools also have target schools that they prefer to hire from.

If you're interested in research, there may be some consideration for what you want to do in your undergrad since universities...

## 2. Understanding Different Degree Paths

### 2.1 Career Prospects from Your Degree

We can split up jobs into ones that require you finish a specific degree (nursing, medicine, law as examples), and degrees where you can vaguely do 'something' and get a relevant job. Nursing and teaching also have placements in their course (though they're currently unpaid).

The first set of degrees provide some sort of accreditation after you finish your degree, and may be a requirement to enter that industry. For instance, engineering degrees are accredited with Engineering Australia.

That's not to say all accreditations are meaningful. For instance, some universities boast that their computer science degrees are ACS (Australian Computing Society) accredited, which doesn't really mean a lot, it just tells you that there's a unit or two that's designed to be a checkbox for them.

Degrees that are considered quantitative (mathematics, computer science, machine learning/data science, physics, statistics, engineering) allow you to apply for most software engineering-adjacent roles. Hell, I even know a nursing student who interned at Atlassian as a software engineer, and several medicine students who interned as traders (though this is less surprising). The primary common element of the quantitative degrees is that you do some sort of mathematical study (even if briefly) along with some mandated coding unit (generalising here). The standards vary from company to company, but by and large, you can learn the basics necessary to pass assessments and the internship will teach you the other elements necessary to succeed.

### 2.2 Deep Dive: Specific Degrees

I cannot speak broadly for every degree, but for some of the STEM specific degrees, I can give you a bit of a breakdown of what to expect, and what sort of career paths they lead to.

#### 2.2.1 Mathematics as a Degree

What does it mean to study mathematics? Many students in high school misattribute studying maths to being able to *compute* results, as opposed to building a theory that's composed of definitions and theorems for some result. So, there's a common misconception that being good at maths is being able to do arithmetic quickly, being able to differentiate some expression, determine an integral, and so on. Consequently, many students hit a hard wall when they reach university and find that mathematics is also about rigour, and proving theorems. This wall is common around linear algebra where you're required to prove basic theorems about vector spaces, so you can use them later on. That's not to say mathematics should only be rigour, as there are countless applications (physics, machine learning, finance, economics, science) but to study mathematics is to build that core so you have the tools to attack related fields.

One statement I've stood by for years is that mathematics is the best complimentary degree choice you'll find. It is incredibly versatile, as any quantitative field at high levels really makes use of mathematics. In my own field of deep learning, we require probability theory (up to measure theory) as a framework for studying uncertainty in model fitting, differential calculus+optimisation for training models and propagating signals, stochastic calculus and partial differential equations for more state-of-the-art models (score based diffusion for image generation). Obviously, you can get away with just knowing linear algebra and multivariate calculus but your baseline grows tremendously as you understand more maths.

The same is true for anyone interested in quantitative finance, (specifically quantitative research, not so much software engineering [footnote]) with mathematical finance driving a lot of innovation such as the ability to price options with the Black-Scholes model. This doesn't even need to be stated for a field like physics where many physicists have pushed innovations in mathematics (Richard Feynmann) to better model whatever they were doing with their research. As an example, complex numbers frequently crop up due to their nice structure in quantum mechanics. And even if you choose not to go into academia as a mathematician, having the machinery of mathematics lets you rigorously build and reason with constructs/ideas in different fields. Linear algebra is probably the most prolific example of being everywhere in science as you get a whole lot of theorems for free when you know something is linear (what does it mean to be linear?).

-->

#### 2.2.6 Law in Your Undergrad

While not my area of expertise, you can do law (LLB) in your undergraduate, as opposed to doing a general undergrad at the University of Melbourne, and then doing a really, really expensive Juris Doctor (JD). If you're absolutely certain you want to do law, consider doing the undergraduate degree at a university that offers it. For this reason, people do a double degree with law, to see if they want to pursue law, and if they're not interested, they drop law, or the other degree.

### 2.3 The UniMelb Model

This one is a bit of a doozy for me. I've met people who've benefitted under this model, and people who've hated the UniMelb model. For those unfamiliar, UniMelb bachelor degrees are 3 years (with some offering 1 year diplomas) that also consist of a UniMelb breadth study of eight units (a year's worth). The other issue is that there are [relatively few science honours streams](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/honours/bachelor-of-science-degree-with-honours/structure/#nav) at UniMelb, with you being required to take on a relevant masters program instead. This is common for STEM students, where they may have to go to another university to study an honours year.

## 3. Academic Excellence

### 3.1 Study Habits and Learning

It is a fact that if you enjoy what you learn, that you'll likely be better at it, primarily because you're willing to dedicate more time to it. This sounds like a ridiculously straightforward statement but it bears worth stating. A lot of students who enter university don't really know how to learn, and typically rote-learn from their tutors. I've seen students with very high ATARs slam into university courses while students with more passion ace university.

### 3.2 Becoming Good at Learning

University functions as a place for learning. Many people see it as an ends to employment, which is where university seems to be heading. One of the most invaluable life skills you'll come into possession is the able to learn, and establish a strong skill to learn a whole range of things.

### 3.3 Using AI Effectively

Since I'm an applied scientist/machine learning engineer, I somehow feel compelled to write on this topic. Though, my interests are more with training models, than using them. I recall ChatGPT coming into existence around 2022, though I was already familiar with GPT-2 and GPT-3 as I had been fine-tuning the former for a really dumb task.

By the time ChatGPT was picking up, I was in my final year (and doing my honours thesis), which I wrote mostly without AI. That being said, how should you use AI in your respective field? I personally would avoid using it at all for assessments as you won't grow the skills to do tasks manually. The ability to do small, menial tasks with consistency is what makes someone really good at executing tasks in general.

That being said, I've found AI is exceedingly useful for accelerating learning if done right. We're in interesting times where models have been rapidly evolving in their capability (though usually overestimated), and I regularly make use of LLMs to summarise papers to see if there's information valuable to me.
