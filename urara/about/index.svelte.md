## About Me 

Hello there! I'm Sai kumar (you can call me Sai). 


I'm currently in my third year at Monash University, studying applied data science. Don't let that fool you though, I do a lot of software engineering work in my spare time! I'm also the current events director for the 
Monash Association of Coding (MAC for short) and have led a variety of workshops in my time, including conducting over 20 mock technical interviews, 3 workshops and helped grow our club to over 600 members (I like to think so anyway...)!

This is my personal site, where I host information about my personal projects, and blog pieces that I think would be interesting to read. You can filter posts by their type on the right on the main page and as of now, there are three types:

- blog-post: A standard blog post, typically on the longer end.
- daily-leetcode: Daily leetcode solutions.
- summary: A short condensed summary of a project.

If for some reason, you want to contact me, my email is linked in my resume, or alternatively, you can contact me via LinkedIn (My full name) or on Discord, at Theorvolt#6887.

Have fun reading!
