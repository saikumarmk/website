## About Me 

Hello there! I'm Sai Kumar (you can call me Sai). 


I'm currently in my final year at Monash University, doing an honours year in applied data science. Don't let that fool you though, I do a lot of software engineering work in my spare time! I'm also the current president for the 
Monash Association of Coding (MAC for short) and have led a variety of workshops in my time, including conducting over 20 mock technical interviews, and 3 workshops and helped grow our club to over 900 members (I like to think so anyway). In addition, I also previously interned at a web design company named Canva and will be returning there as a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE), so if you have any questions about the company, feel free to reach out. My interests lie in ML/DL, specifically generative AI, which is what my research and intern work at Canva involved, specifically diagnosing and mitigating bias in text-to-image models, but also extending to text-to-text models, networks, and anything machine learning.

This is my personal site, where I host information about my personal projects and blog pieces that I think would be interesting to read. 

If for some reason, you want to contact me, my email is linked in my resume, or alternatively, you can contact me via LinkedIn (My full name) or on Discord, at Theorvolt~~#6887~~. My GitHub is [saikumarmk](https://github.com/saikumarmk) if you're interested in seeing my other works.

Have fun reading!
