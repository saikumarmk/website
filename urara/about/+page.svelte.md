## About Me 

Hello there! I'm Sai kumar (you can call me Sai). 


I'm currently in my fourth year at Monash University, studying applied data science. Don't let that fool you though, I do a lot of software engineering work in my spare time! I'm also the current president for the 
Monash Association of Coding (MAC for short) and have led a variety of workshops in my time, including conducting over 20 mock technical interviews, 3 workshops and helped grow our club to over 600 members (I like to think so anyway). In addition, I interned as a Machine Learning engineer at Canva, a web design company, so if you have any questions about the company, feel free to reach out. I will also be working there from next year :)

This is my personal site, where I host information about my personal projects, and blog pieces that I think would be interesting to read. 

If for some reason, you want to contact me, my email is linked in my resume, or alternatively, you can contact me via LinkedIn (My full name) or on Discord, at Theorvolt#6887.

Have fun reading!
