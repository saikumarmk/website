Hello there! I'm Sai Kumar (you can call me Sai). 


I'm a soon-to-be graduate from Monash University, having completed my honours year in [Applied Data Science](https://handbook.monash.edu/current/courses/S3003), with my thesis being on "Bias Modelling Mitigation in Diffusion Models". I was also the former president of the Monash Association of Coding (MAC), where we saw record growth to over 1000 members, more significant flagship events such as our Tech Careers Evening and MACathon, mock interviews, and more frequent events.

Separate from my university experience, I also interned at Canva, a beginner-friendly web design company. I'll be returning there as a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE), focusing on generative AI in text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Imagen, Midjourney, and so on. My interests lie in the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision, specifically in the form of diffusion-based text-to-image models, which my thesis is based on; however, I am interested in all areas of machine learning.


If you have any questions about my experiences at Canva or want to explore my personal projects and blog pieces, feel free to reach out. You can contact me via email (linked in my resume), on LinkedIn using my full name, or find me on Discord at Theorvolt~~#6887~~. Also, remember to check out my GitHub, where you can explore my other works at [saikumarmk](https://github.com/saikumarmk/).

Happy reading!
